The Secret Garden

You discover a hidden garden behind the castle walls.
Beautiful roses and ancient statues fill this mystical place.

At the center, you find a stone pedestal with an inscription:

"Part 1 of the Golden Key lies beneath the statue of the Phoenix.
The Phoenix statue bears the number: 7"

Additional clue carved in stone:
"When combined with the Tower's number, multiply them and add 3.
The result reveals the location of Part 3."

Garden Keeper's name: Isabella
