The North Tower

You climb the spiral staircase of the ancient North Tower.
At the top, you find a locked chest with a riddle engraved on it.

Riddle:
"Part 2 of the Golden Key rests within this chest.
The chest can only be opened by speaking the architect's name."

On the wall, there's a number carved: 5

Tower Guardian's message:
"Remember: Multiply my number with the Garden's number, then add 3.
This will give you the room number in treasure.txt where Part 3 is hidden."

Tower Height: 5 floors
